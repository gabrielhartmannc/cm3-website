## A smaller level Heading

### And even smaller

Just write to start a para. Use `**word**` to bold **word**. Use `*word*` to *italicise*. For a new para, you need to hit return at-least twice.

This is another para.

In this one we show some lists. just start the lista on the next line after hitting one return:
- an item
- another item
- one more item

In this new para we create a numbered list using numbers.
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

This shorthand is called Markdown. It is a general text format used almost everywhere on the web. [Google](https://www.google.com) (see how I made this link) about it to learn more.

You can write code by using triple-ticks:

```python
print("This is my first time making a website using HTML")
```

This page illustrates low code principles. In exchange for giving up pixel-level control of the page you can make web pages easily through a simple text file.
